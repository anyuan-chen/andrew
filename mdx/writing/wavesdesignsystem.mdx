Design systems feel like a mainstay of the modern tech world. Everybody, from industry giants like Google to three-month old startups seems to have created
design language to unify their work across platforms.

<br />
<br />
Flipping through documentation on Material for the first time, I was caught by
surprise by the sheer detail of the specification. From typography to the minute
details of text alignment, Material seemingly had an answer to every single
question. As I explored Polaris and Carbon, similarly detailed specifications
followed.

To understand how to build a design systems - a rationale on why these design
systems are necessary for the construction of effective applications is
required. In the pre-design system era of development, one large problem was
visual inconsistency. Though it may seem like a small issue if two elements with
the same function are visually distinguishable from each other, this presents
two issues. First, it hurts the company brand by giving a sense of chaos and
disunity. Next, and perhaps more importantly, it jeopardizes the user experience
by having the user learn more patterns than is truly necessary. The lack of a
standardized set of design guidelines can also lead to visual confusion - every
engineer may think in a different way and thus implement key visual elements as
such. If one engineer decides yellow is an appropriate color for a warning, and
the other for a successful purchase, the lack of visual coherency will cause
user frustration.
<br />
<br />
Thus, one of the main goals of the design system is to tackle this exact problem
by restricting the creative liberties given to engineers with regards to UI, while
allowing them to still implement functional components.
<br />
<br />
The ways in which specific design systems do this vary, with each system
combining a multitude of tools. Some, like Mailchimp, have created a shared
visual identity through type. Others, like Shopify, have chosen to focus more on
color and use system fonts. In today's tech world, inconsistent UI is fairly
rare outside the occasional outlier (looking at you, Valve), and we have the
hard work of the designers and enginers behind design systems to thank for that.
